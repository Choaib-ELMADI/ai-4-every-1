1. CPUs:
    . CPU = Central Processing Unit
    . CPUs use sequential computation (processing).
    . CPUs can only do one task at a time.
    . CPUs are designed for more complicated tasks (i.e: Complex Math Problem).

2. GPUs:
    . GPU = Graphics Processing Unit
    . GPUs use parallel computation (processing).
    . GPUs can do multiple tasks at a time.
    . GPUs are designed for simple tasks (i.e: Brick Laying Problem).
