1. Artificial Intelligence:
    . Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to any human-like behavior displayed by a machine or a system.

2. Machine Learning:
    . Machine Learning is part of Artificial Intelligence.
    . It's based on the implicit programming and not the explicit one (if statements, for loops, ...).

3. Deep Learning:
    . Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning inspired by the human brain.
    . The backbone of Deep Learning is the concept of Neural Networks.
    . A neural network consists of several layers:
        * Input Layer
        .
        |
        * Hidden Layers (as many as you need/want)
        |
        .
        * Output Layer
    . Each layer consists of several neurons.
    . Each neuron is connected to the neurons in the next layer.
    . Each connection between two neurons has a weight. While training, it changes these weights (like knobs) to get better results.

4. Discriminative AI:
    . A subset of Deep Learning that learns from the relationships between labels of data points.
    
5. Generative AI:
    . A subset of Deep Learning that generates a totally new data (text, image, video, audio, ...).
    . Some generative AI models:
        * Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):
            => It consists of two neural networks competing against each other.
            => One generates new content and the other evaluates how good it is.
        * Variational AutoEncoder (VAE):
            => They generate new instances similar to the input data.
        * Diffusion Models:
        * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):
            => Sequential computing.
        * Transformers (Updated RNNs):
            => Parallel computing.
